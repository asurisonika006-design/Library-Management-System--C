# Library Management System in C

This is my **first project posted on GitHub**!

A simple **command-line Library Management System** written in **C**. This program allows you to manage a small library by adding, viewing, searching, issuing, returning, and removing books. It is designed for beginners learning **C programming** and basic data structures using **arrays and structs**.

## Features
- Add new books with **Title, Author, and ISBN**  
- View all books in the library  
- Search for a book by **ISBN**  
- Issue a book (mark as issued)  
- Return a book (mark as available)  
- Remove a book from the library  
- Simple menu-driven interface

## How to Run
1. Make sure **GCC** or another C compiler is installed  
2. Save the file as `library_management.c`  
3. Open terminal or command prompt in the folder  
4. Compile the program:
```bash
gcc library_management.c -o library_management
