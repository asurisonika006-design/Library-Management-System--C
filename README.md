# Library-Management-System--C
This is my first project posted on GitHub!  A simple command-line Library Management System written in C. This program allows you to manage a small library by adding, viewing, searching, issuing, returning, and removing books. It is designed for beginners learning C programming and basic data structures using arrays and structs.
